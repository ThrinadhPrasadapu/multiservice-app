# Multiservice-app

This is a simple full-stack CRUD application illustrating how to configure a multi-service monolithic architecture using Docker. The application consists of a React frontend built with Vite, an Express backend running on Node.js, MongoDB for data persistence, Redis for caching, and an Nginx reverse proxy to manage incoming requests. This project serves as an example of orchestrating multiple services together with Docker Compose
